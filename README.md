# Blockchain-Based Specialized Medical Equipment Tracking (BSMET)

A decentralized platform for transparent, secure, and compliant lifecycle management of critical medical equipment.

## Overview

BSMET revolutionizes how healthcare facilities manage specialized medical equipment by leveraging blockchain technology to create immutable records of device registration, calibration history, usage patterns, maintenance activities, and regulatory compliance. This system enhances patient safety, optimizes equipment utilization, ensures regulatory adherence, and extends the operational lifespan of valuable medical assets.

## Core Components

### 1. Device Registration Contract

Creates and maintains comprehensive digital identities for specialized medical equipment.

- **Asset Tokenization**: Generates unique digital identifiers for each medical device
- **Specification Repository**: Stores technical parameters, serial numbers, and model information
- **Ownership Chain**: Tracks custody transfers throughout device lifecycle
- **Documentation Storage**: Links to manuals, warranties, and certification documents
- **Location Tracking**: Records current and historical placement within facilities

### 2. Calibration Tracking Contract

Manages and verifies regular accuracy assessments for precision medical instruments.

- **Calibration Schedule**: Automates timing of required accuracy verifications
- **Tolerance Parameters**: Records acceptable performance thresholds by device type
- **Technician Verification**: Validates credentials of calibration personnel
- **Results Documentation**: Stores detailed calibration measurements and findings
- **Certificate Generation**: Creates digital proof of successful calibration events

### 3. Usage Logging Contract

Records detailed utilization data for equipment operation and patient interaction.

- **Operation Records**: Tracks equipment activation, duration, and shutdown
- **User Authentication**: Verifies authorized operators for each usage session
- **Patient Association**: Links anonymized patient identifiers to equipment usage
- **Procedure Coding**: Classifies usage by medical procedure type
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitors operational parameters during use

### 4. Maintenance Scheduling Contract

Coordinates and manages preventive and corrective maintenance activities.

- **Maintenance Calendar**: Schedules regular service based on manufacturer specifications
- **Service Provider Management**: Tracks authorized technicians and service companies
- **Parts Inventory**: Manages replacement component availability and usage
- **Alert Generation**: Notifies stakeholders of upcoming or overdue maintenance
- **Issue Tracking**: Documents reported problems and resolution status

### 5. Compliance Verification Contract

Ensures adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards.

- **Regulatory Framework**: Maps applicable regulations to specific equipment types
- **Audit Trail**: Maintains comprehensive history of compliance activities
- **Expiration Management**: Tracks certification and license renewal requirements
- **Deviation Reporting**: Documents non-compliance events and corrective actions
- **Inspection Records**: Stores results of regulatory agency reviews
